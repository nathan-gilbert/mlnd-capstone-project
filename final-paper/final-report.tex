\begin{abstract}
Everyday we are bombarded with more information than is possible to process.
Identifying and summarizing relevant information in a given document is a task
that can help reduce the time required for acquiring and acting on new
information. Accurate summaries can reduce reading time and personalized
summaries could help a reader better understand material they care about most.
